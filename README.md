ImageFind
=========

Find Images through queries from command line and display them.
It is pretty rudimentary, so please don't take it to heart. It has been tested on Mac OSX 10.8+, though
with a few changes should work on linux too.
I plan to add some command line options in the future.
Have fun lolling!
